<- CollectionsApp ->

    When you click collections it opens a SPA (single page application).

    The application has two windows.

    The window on the left is called Navigator.

    Navigator displays a list of collections or playlists.

    The window on the right is called Viewer.

    Viewer displays a Header and a list (SongList) of songs (Song) from a selected playlist or collection.

    If no playlist or collection is selected the Viewer shows message "Select playlist or collection to display".

    {*playlist === Spotify playlist}

    Navigator and Viewer can operate in two modes:
       1) playlist mode;
       2) collection mode.

    The modes of Navigator and Viewer are separated, i.e. Navigator can be used to browse collections in collection mode and Viewer can be displaying a playlist in playlist mode.

<- Navigator ->

Navigator contains:
    - A heading that says "Your playlists" or "Your collections" depending on mode.
    - A list of playlist/collection names
    - A button to switch Navigator mode

Navigator->PlaylistMode
