Primary goals / functions for application

1. Load a playlist from spotify -> sort / filter music by genre, artist, album, year etc.
2. Create new playlists / collections and add to spotify playlists
3. Get suggested artists from recently listened artists
4. Find unpopular artists

The ideas for the application:

    Create a personalized library / collection of user's favourite music and artists

    Collect listening data from user's linked Spotify or Last.fm account

    Make it more lightweight / simple than last.fm

    Analyze listening habits and suggest similar artists to current preferences

    Suggest new music based on favourite artists

    Additional features:

        - create must listen / suggestion playlists / collections / lists of music / artists and share with friends

        - create playlists which maybe could be uploaded to Spotify

        - comments / chat feature

    Take music from spotify liked tracks / playlists and organize by genre / date of release / listen counts
